## Introductions
Laser cutting is great for making gifts, so I figured I'd make a gift for one of my friends in the form of a pencil holder/cup/whatchamacallit. I also thought that making something like this would be a good way to get into 3D rapid prototyping via laser cutting, since 2D machining is a little easier on harder materials like acrylic and metal if I wanted to use the waterjet, etc. It's also nice that it's much easier to print patterns, and Illustrator has an easy "image trace" function (more on that below). 

## Pattern and Kerf (Test Run, Nolop)
**(2/21/23)** As of the writing of this post, I wasn't sure if I would be able to do my fabrication on the Bray machines - so I decided to do a Nolop test run to take a look at how different patterns come out on frosted acrylic and to note the relevant kerf for that laser cutter.

OUTLINE
1) Cut a random square + etching + raster to take a look at how each comes out on acrylic and to ID kerf. Came out really well (could have just submitted this haha, but I wanted to make something cooler), so move onto step 2: CAD
