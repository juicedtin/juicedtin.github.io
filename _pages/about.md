_(MEDIA REMODEL PENDING)_

Hi! My name is Justin Wang and I'm majoring in Biomedical Engineering at Tufts University - Class of 2024. I was born and raised in San Diego, California (although I like Boston better, don't tell my parents), and I went to high school at Canyon Crest Academy in Del Mar. I'm currently working in the Kaplan and Timko Labs, on silk biomaterial fabrication and silicon nanowire fabrication. 
In my free time, I enjoy writing/worldbuilding (I play DnD with an old friend group and I like daydreaming) and gaming - VALORANT, League, Destiny are the current highlights. I'm also a casual-ish anime watcher, although I usually use my friends for recommendations: my favorites are _Cyberpunk Edgerunners_, _Steins:Gate_, _Code Geass_, _86_, and I'm working my way through _Psycho Pass_ as of early 2023. Feel free to contact me at any of the various contacts scattered throughout this website, I'm always happy to talk about research, sci-fi, or anything in between!
